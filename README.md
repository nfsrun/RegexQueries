### Description
Regex exercise project consists of two classes that do two different text extrapolations per scenario. 
1. The first one is VariableAnalysis class. This class will process a java file and output all variables within it (including type, variable name, and value if applicable). Uses regex completely to process it. 
2. Lastly comes the CourseSchedule.java class. When running this program, the program will ask users a couple of questions in regards to the Bellevue College schedule and process the Bellevue College website to output the list of available departments for the quarter. Then, it will ask two more questions in regards to a specific class and that class' available time schedules would appear. Regex (and two instances of String's substring) were used in this project. __Note: I have tested ENGL 072 and such a class will not work as a combination class!! However, the other class connected to it, ENGL 092, should work!! Also, some classes that have an ampersand in the title would display as &amp;. __
